## AIM:
To explore and document UX project scenarios by identifying user problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and creating user personas to guide design decisions.

## PROCEDURE:
1.Select two different UX project scenarios (e.g., a health tracking app and an e-commerce website) for analysis.

2.Identify key user pain points in each scenario and write 1–2 UX problem statements using the template:
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

3.Choose suitable UX research methods such as surveys, interviews, or usability testing based on the problem context and target audience.

4.Justify the selection of each research method by explaining how it helps gather relevant user insights.

5.Create at least two detailed user personas for each scenario, including demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations.

6.Use the personas and problem statements to inform future design decisions and guide the user experience strategy.

## Designing a Mental Health & Wellness App
## 1. UX Problem Statements
Pain Points Identified:
• Users feel overwhelmed by generalized mental health advice.
• Users struggle to track moods and journal consistently.
• Lack of personalization leads to low engagement.
Problem Statement 1:
“Young adults dealing with stress and anxiety need a way to access personalized wellness 
routines because generalized tips don’t address individual triggers and lifestyles, which 
results in decreased app engagement and ineffective self-care.”
Problem Statement 2:
“Users need a way to track and reflect on their moods easily because current apps are 
either too complex or lack visual insights, which results in dropped usage and inconsistent 
self-monitoring.”
## 2. Research Methods
Chosen Methods:
• User Interviews: To understand individual stress triggers, app usage habits, and 
expectations.
• Diary Studies: To track emotional patterns, journaling behaviors, and app 
interaction over time.
Justification:
• Interviews provide deep insights into mental health experiences and unmet needs.
• Diary studies capture real-time behavior and emotional fluctuations, crucial for a 
mental wellness context.
